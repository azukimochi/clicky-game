# Cartoon Memory Game

This react application is a memory game themed after iconic cartoon characters.  Users earn a point when they click on unique characters.  If they accidentally click on a character that they already selected previously, the game will end.  A top score is maintained until your session ends. 

This react application was created using React, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, and Yarn.  It has been deployed on Github (gh-pages) and on Heroku.
